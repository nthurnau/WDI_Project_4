##StyleGuide.com - WDI Project 4


StyleGuide.com was created by Nicole Thurnau for her final WDI project.<br><br>
####Objective <br>
StyleGuide.com is just the blog you want to read if you're interested in improving your home decor and personal style! StyleGuide.com offers easy to follow, *free* tutorials AND the things you need to make them happen. No other style blog offers both the great resources that make your life more adorable and a way to purchase the materials you need all in one place. 

####Project Requirements<br>
The project requirements listed below were provided by the project markdown:

-  Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end
- Have an API of your design
- Have an interactive front-end, preferably using a modern front-end framework
- Be a complete product, which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple models
- Use a database, whether that's one we've covered in class or one you want to learn
-  Implement thoughtful [user stories](https://trello.com/b/Q1aaFvVW/wdi-project-4-styleguides) that are significant enough to help you know which features to build and which to scrap
- Have a visually impressive design to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers
- Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible

####Necessary Deliverables
- A working API, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A working front-end, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A link to your hosted working app in the URL section of your Github repo
- A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
- A readme.md file with:
  - An embedded screenshot of the app
  - Explanations of the technologies used
  - A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took
  - Installation instructions for any dependencies
  - Link to your user stories – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
  - Link to your wireframes – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
  - Link to your pitch deck – documentation of your wireframes, user stories, and proposed architecture
Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome

####Technologies Used
- MongoDB
- Express.js
- Angular.js
- Node.js
- JavaScript
- HTML5
- Materialize Styling Libraries
- (Stripe API)
- (Google Analytics API)

####Installation Instructions
If you wish to install my app and mess around with the components, you will need to:
1) Fork my github repo.<br>
2) Git clone to your local repository/workspace.<br>
3) In the terminal, you will need to navigate to your repo with my project and npm install the NPM packages that I have used (they include ...)


####Approach Taken
1) First I looked at several popular style blogs and evaluaed their strengths and weaknesses. I researched technologies they used to create their blogs and inspected their sites. I also wrote a thorough [proposal](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s172/sh/924bd298-eb0c-46e5-9635-1ea86618de43/56af7f93f77e5bb390f79898c988192c) and presented it to my instructors.<br>

2) Next, I drew [wireframes and wrote user stories](https://trello.com/b/Q1aaFvVW/wdi-project-4-styleguides) of my views for use as a guide for the design and an outline of important components that my views would need. <br>

3) Then, I built out the site, starting with the back end. I followed that by creating Angular elements and implementing Materialize and CSS for styling.
